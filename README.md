## About

This repository contains my implementation of the **libft** project at 42 School.  
Libft is a foundational project that involves recreating a set of standard C library functions as well as some additional utilities.  
It aims to build a solid understanding of C programming, pointers, memory management, and string manipulation.


## Compilation

Each module follows the same compilation standards:

```bash

# Compile with Makefile
make

# Clean object files
make clean

# Clean everything
make fclean

# Recompile
make re
```


## Key Concepts Learned

### Fundamental C Programming
- **Pointers and Memory**: Mastery of pointer manipulation and dynamic memory allocation
- **String Manipulation**: Building and handling strings at a low level
- **Data Structures**: Implementing linked lists and managing nodes
- **Function Pointers**: Using callbacks for flexible function design

### Library Development
- **Modular Code**: Creating reusable and self-contained functions
- **Header and Source Separation**: Organizing code for clarity and maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Defensive programming and consistent return values
- **Code Norm Compliance**: Adhering to 42’s coding standards and style guides
  
### Core C Concepts
- **Memory Management**: Manual allocation, deallocation, and avoiding leaks
- **Bitwise Operations**: Understanding low-level data manipulation (where applicable)
- **Static vs Dynamic Linking**: Basics of library creation and usage
- **Function Reimplementation**: Deep understanding through re-coding standard libc functions


## Skills Developed

- **C Language Proficiency:**: Solid grasp of C syntax and semantics
- **Low-level Programming**: Effective use of pointers, memory, and system calls
- **Library Creation**: Building a foundational C library with useful utilities
- **Problem Solving**: Tackling edge cases and implementing robust algorithms
- **Code Quality & Style**: Writing clean, readable, and norm-compliant code
- **Debugging and Testing**: Validating function correctness and memory safety


## Modules Overview

The libft project consists of reimplementing a set of standard C library functions as well as utility functions frequently used in larger projects. It serves as a foundational step to deepen understanding of C programming, memory management, and modular code design.

You will implement functions for:
- Character and string manipulation (e.g., ft_strlen, ft_strchr, ft_strncmp)
- Memory management (e.g., ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_calloc)
- Conversion and checks (e.g., ft_atoi, ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit)
- Linked lists (creating, adding, deleting nodes)
- Output functions (e.g., ft_putchar_fd, ft_putstr_fd)

This project prepares you for more advanced topics by enforcing strict coding standards, deepening your C expertise, and encouraging clean, reusable code.
